### Zero-shot Classification

**Core Concept**: Performing classification tasks without explicit training data, purely via prompt engineering with an LLM.

**Example**:
Prompt: "Is the following review positive or negative?\nReview: 'The app crashes frequently.'"

Output: "Negative."

**Critical Concept**: No labeled training required, model infers directly from prompt context.

---

### Gradio and LangServe

**Core Concept**: Simplified interfaces to deploy interactive apps (Gradio) and LLM API endpoints (LangServe).

**Example Implementation (Gradio)**:

input_json = '{"query": "Tell me about AI."}'
validated_query = Query.model_validate_json(input_json)
```

---

### Context Limits

**Core Concept**: LLMs have token-length limits, necessitating chunking documents and summarizing context.

**Example**:
Chunk large documents (~5000 words) into 1000-token pieces, embedding each separately before retrieval.

Critical: Balance between completeness and summarization accuracy.

---

### Bi-Encoders & Cross-Encoders

**Core Concept**:  
- Bi-encoders encode query and documents separately, fast retrieval.

- Cross-encoder re-ranks top-10 documents accurately.

---

### Knowledge Bases

**Core Concept**: Structured information repositories (graphs/databases) integrated into RAG agents for precise retrieval.

**Example**:
Query: "Who is the CEO of Tesla?"
System queries knowledge base (structured DB) for accurate response, improving reliability vs. pure LLM answer.

---

### Document Embeddings

**Core Concept**: Numerical vectors capturing semantic meaning, enabling similarity search.

**Example**:
Document "Climate Change Impacts" and user query "Effects of global warming" share embedding proximity, retrieved as context for answering.

---

### Synthetic Data

**Core Concept**: Artificial data generation to supplement or evaluate AI models when real data is limited or sensitive.

**Example**:
Generate synthetic queries/answers to robustly train or test chatbots without real customer data.
