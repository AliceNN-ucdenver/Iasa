| **Zero-shot Classification** | Leveraging LLMs to classify text without explicit training on labeled data, relying solely on natural language prompts. | **Example**: "Does the following text reflect positive or negative sentiment? 'The movie was thrilling.'" Model answers directly based on prompt comprehension.<br>**Critical**: Eliminates the need for extensive training datasets for classification tasks. | [Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652) |

| **Context limits** | Defines the maximum input size of tokens an LLM can handle, influencing RAG design decisions regarding document chunking. | **Example**: GPT-4 has an 8K or 32K context limit, requiring large documents to be segmented into manageable chunks.<br>**Critical**: Directly affects retrieval strategies and model accuracy. | [Tiktokenizer: OpenAI's Tokenizer](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) |
| **Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders** | Embedding methods: Bi-encoders encode queries/documents independently for fast retrieval. Cross-encoders jointly encode query-document pairs, improving accuracy at computational expense. | **Example**: Fast semantic search (bi-encoder) vs. accurate re-ranking of top results (cross-encoder).<br>**Critical**: Balancing speed versus accuracy in document retrieval. | [SBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) |
| **Knowledge bases** | Structured representations of knowledge in databases or graphs, queried to enhance RAG answers. | **Example**: A DevOps chatbot using a knowledge graph to answer specific infrastructure questions.<br>**Critical**: Offers structured, relational context to LLMs. | [LangChain Knowledge Graph](https://blog.langchain.dev/using-a-knowledge-graph-to-implement-a-devops-rag-application/) |
| **Document embeddings** | Vector representations encoding document semantics, crucial for effective similarity search. | **Example**: Converting text documents into embeddings to find relevant articles in a vector database. | [Sentence-BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) |
