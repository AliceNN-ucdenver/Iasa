# Graduate Certificate: IT Architecture

The graduate certificate in IT Architecture is designed for working professionals or computer science students beginning careers in the fields of IT architecture, solution design, and digital transformation.

This certificate requires a previous computer science or related technical degree. At the start of the certificate program, students are expected to have a strong understanding of software development, basic system design, and fundamental IT concepts.

## Curriculum

Students will complete a sequence of three separate graduate-level courses:

* CSCI 5XXX Foundations of IT Architecture **-and-**
* CSCI 5XXX Solution Architecture and Design
**And** one of the following:
* CSCI 5593 Advanced Computer Architecture 

Students must take and pass each course with a B- or better and earn a GPA of at least 3.0 to obtain the IT Architecture Certificate.

Students currently enrolled in the CU Denver bachelor of science in computer science program are eligible for this certificate with the recommendation of their advisor.

## Course Objectives

### CSCI 5XXX Foundations of IT Architecture

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to IT architecture principles and practices. Students will:

1. Understand the core concepts of IT architecture and its role in business technology strategy.
2. Learn to analyze and design IT environments considering quality attributes such as performance, scalability, and security.
3. Develop skills in architectural design, including modeling and documentation techniques.
4. Gain knowledge of innovation management and agile methodologies in architecture.
5. Practice stakeholder engagement and learn to create effective architecture roadmaps.

### CSCI 5XXX Solution Architecture and Design

This advanced course focuses on the practical aspects of solution architecture. Students will:

1. Master the role and responsibilities of a solution architect.
2. Learn to align business objectives with architectural solutions.
3. Gain proficiency in solution architecture processes, including documentation and traceability.
4. Understand how to implement agile architecture at scale and integrate with DevOps practices.
5. Develop skills in cloud architecture and digital transformation strategies.
6. Practice creating comprehensive solution architectures for real-world scenarios.
