## The Architecture Challenge
Every great organization needs great architects. But how do you develop them? The IASA ATLAS (Architecture Teaching, Learning And Support) program introduces a revolutionary approach: bringing the time-tested teaching hospital model to technology architecture. Through our comprehensive program and proven learning materials, we transform promising technologists into capable architects while reducing costs and improving quality.

Today's organizations face critical architectural challenges:
- Shortage of experienced architects
- High costs of senior-level dependency
- Inconsistent development practices
- Knowledge loss risks
- Limited career pathways
