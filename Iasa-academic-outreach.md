# Project Atlas University Outreach and Accreditation

This document outlines a strategy for outreach and accreditation for Project Atlas, an IASA academic program designed to transform IT architecture education.

## Outreach Strategy

To effectively engage with target universities and promote Project Atlas, the following outreach strategy is recommended:

**1. Identify Key Contacts:**

*   Conduct thorough research to identify faculty members specializing in software architecture, systems engineering, or related fields within the target universities.
*   Utilize online resources such as university websites, faculty directories, and research databases to gather contact information.
*   Prioritize contacting department heads or program coordinators to gain insights into curriculum development and potential collaboration opportunities.

**2. Personalized Outreach:**

*   Craft personalized emails or letters to introduce Project Atlas and its value proposition to each university.
*   Highlight the program's alignment with IASA's CITA-F certification, its focus on industry-relevant skills, and the potential for student career advancement.
*   Emphasize the benefits of partnering with IASA, including access to standardized curriculum materials, faculty development programs, and industry connections.

**3. Leverage Existing Networks:**

*   Utilize IASA's network of members and industry partners to connect with university faculty and establish relationships.
*   Attend relevant conferences and workshops to engage with academic communities and promote Project Atlas.

**4. Offer Value Propositions:**

*   Clearly articulate the benefits of partnering with IASA, such as:
    *   Enhanced curriculum and teaching materials
    *   Access to industry experts and mentorship opportunities
    *   Opportunities for joint research projects
    *   Potential for student internships and placements

## Accreditation Process

To ensure the quality and recognition of Project Atlas, the following accreditation process should be considered:

**1. Identify an Accreditation Body:**

*   Research and select an accreditation body that specializes in computer science, engineering, or IT programs.
*   Consider reputable organizations such as ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) or regional accreditation agencies.

**2. Develop a Self-Study Report:**

*   Prepare a comprehensive self-study report that details the program's curriculum, learning outcomes, faculty qualifications, and available resources.
*   Ensure the report addresses the specific standards and criteria set by the chosen accreditation body.

**3. Peer Review:**

*   The accreditation body will conduct a peer review process, which may involve a site visit and evaluation by a team of experts.
*   Actively participate in the peer review process and address any recommendations or suggestions for improvement.

**4. Final Accreditation Decision:**

*   The accreditation body will make a final decision on the program's accreditation status based on the self-study report, peer review findings, and any further actions taken.
